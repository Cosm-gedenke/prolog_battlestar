there are notably missing predicates from the project as they were part of the auxiliary code given to us in the project, they mostly served the function of giving us coordinates of a map,
with it's respective regions, lines and columns, there's also the particular padraoT that fills the coordinates according to a T pattern(if the conditions meet)
NOTE: the project was done in portuguese and will remain as such
